## **II. Service Description**

### **Core Objectives**

The project aims to develop a **Python-based open-source toolbox** that enables effective **co-registration, calibration, and feature extraction** for aerial multispectral images collected over urban parks. The toolbox will enhance the detection and monitoring of mistletoe species by automating key image processing tasks, ensuring alignment and calibration of spectral data, and providing tools for feature extraction and analysis.

### **Key Features**

1. **Co-registration and Geometric Alignment**: Ensuring spatial alignment between spectral bands and across multiple flight captures.
2. **Spectral Calibration**: Converting raw intensity values into calibrated reflectance values for accurate spectral analysis.
3. **Automatic Image Organization & Preprocessing**: Standardizing image metadata and renaming conventions for consistency across flights.
4. **Feature Extraction & Texture Analysis**: Computing vegetation indices and texture-based features for mistletoe detection.
5. **Data Management & Export**: Storing processed data in GIS-compatible formats for integration with existing research tools.

By automating these processes, the toolbox will significantly enhance the efficiency of mistletoe species detection and facilitate environmental monitoring efforts.
