# **Multispectral Image Processing Toolbox**

## **Overview**
The **Multispectral Image Processing Toolbox** is an open-source Python-based solution designed for monitoring mistletoe species in urban parks using aerial multispectral imagery. The toolbox supports preprocessing, calibration, alignment, and feature extraction necessary to analyze multispectral datasets efficiently.

### **Core Features**
- **Co-registration and geometric alignment** for spatial consistency.
- **Spectral calibration and reflectance correction** for accurate spectral analysis.
- **Feature extraction and vegetation indices** to identify mistletoe species.
- **Data storage and export tools** for integration with GIS platforms.
- **Automated workflows** to streamline image processing tasks.
